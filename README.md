# Exploring Global Economy, Internet Utilization, and Employment Trends

Global economies and employment markets have undergone a transformation 
due to the quick development of technology and the growing use of the internet. 
The relationship between them has become a crucial field of research as 
countries become more digitally connected.
In order to understand how internet usage affects job trends and economic 
growth, this research explores the interactions among these three variables. 
Given the growth of the digital economy, it is critical to comprehend these 
relationships in order to establish policies that support innovation, sustainable 
development, and fair employment opportunities.
  
### Objectives:
- Analyze global trends in GDP, internet usage, and employment.
- Explore correlations between economic growth and internet 
penetration.
- Use data visualization to identify patterns.
- Provide insights for informed decision-making.

### Data Sources: 
Three datasets were collected from https://data.un.org. 
All are structured in csv format.
○ GDP Data: The dataset includes information about GDP per 
capita across different countries and years.
○ Internet Usage Data: This dataset includes the percentage of 
internet users for various countries and years.
○ Employment Data: This dataset provides employment 
information across countries, segmented by gender.

### Key Findings:
• Internet Usage and Economic Growth: Higher internet usage is 
positively correlated with increased GDP per capita, suggesting that 
digital connectivity contributes to economic growth.
• Employment and GDP Link: Stronger job markets are often seen in 
countries with higher GDP per capita, highlighting the role of economic 
stability in job creation.
• Feedback Loop of Growth Factors: There is a cyclical relationship: 
higher GDP enables investment in digital infrastructure, which enhances 
internet accessibility, leading to more job opportunities and economic 
stability.
• Digital Divide Impact: Regions with limited internet access tend to have 
lower GDP per capita and higher unemployment, pointing to the need for 
targeted efforts to address the digital divide.

### Implications:
• Digital Connectivity as a Growth Catalyst: The internet plays a critical 
role in driving economic growth by improving access to information, 
enabling remote work, and fostering innovation.
• Interlinked Factors for Stability: Economic stability, employment, and 
digital infrastructure are interconnected, suggesting that policy 
improvements in one area can positively influence the others.
• Targeted Policy Action Needed: Bridging the digital divide is essential 
for ensuring equitable access to opportunities, particularly in 
economically disadvantaged regions
